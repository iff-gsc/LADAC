    inducedVelocityWithUnits(T, V_kb, R, rho) %#codegen
% inducedVelocityWithUnits computes all important velocities of a rotor,
% as well as the needed induced power and power for climb.
%
%   The computation is based on the momentum theory. The equation is
%   solved according to [1, page 153]. 
%   This function eliminates the singularity of momentum theory in
%   vortex ring state. This Vortex Ring State model uses third-order
%   polynomials, that connects stepwise the two branches of climb and
%   fast decent. [2, page 14]. This model is based on real rotor test data.
%   This model creates an instability for the vortex ring state. Within
%   the defined boundary the real part of the eigenvalue of heave damping
%   become positive.

% Inputs:
%   T           rotor thrust, positive for regular helicopter operation.
%               (scalar), in N
%   V_kb        velocity of rotor hub. right handed coordinate system.
%               for regular helicopter in hover:
%               x-axis postive in flight direction, y-axis positive to
%               right side and z-axis positive from rotor looking down at
%               the earth. V_kb = [Vx; Vy; Vz].
%               positive Vz means rotor plane is descending;
