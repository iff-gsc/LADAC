function v = wingGetDimlessIndVel( V_inf_local, geometry )
% wingGetDimlessIndVel computes the dimensionless induced velocity for a
% unit circulation normalized by the wing span.
%   The implementation of [1], eq. (6) is used. As we assume that no
%   segment of the horseshoe vortices is crossing a control point and the
%   control points do not lie on the bound segment of the horseshoe
%   vortices, we only use the i~=j part and not the i=j part of [1], eq.
%   (6).
%   Moreover, since it is very common, the dimensionless induced velocity
%   is not normalized by the local chord but by the wing span.
% 
% Inputs:
%   V_inf_local         local free-stream velocity for each panel, signs
%                       are defined for how the vector is seen by the plane
%                       (3xn array)
%   geometry            Wing geometry
%                       (struct, see: wingSetGeometry)
%   
% Outputs:
%   v                   dimensionless induced velocity (unit circulation
%                       and normalized by the wing span)
%                       (3 x Nc x Nv array, where Nc is the number of
%                       control points and Nv is the number of horseshoe
%                       vortices)
