# Wing Aerodynamics with Vortex Lattice Method and Viscous Coupling

This program calculates the lift- drag- and momentum contribution for a specified wing 
according to the vortex lattice method coupled with viscous 2D profile aerodynamics.
The computation is based on a specified wing geometry that is discretized
into multiple wing strips. Note that this implementation currently only supports spanwise discretization
so that there is always only one chordwise panel. For each strip predefined 2D airfoil 
aerodynamics maps are used. Each computation requires an iterative computation
until convergence in case of steady computations. This project also supports unsteady
computations based on 2D unsteady state space models for subsonic Mach numbers.
It is also possible to couple the aerodynamics model with a structural model which
yields and aeroelastic model.

## Motivation 

For flight dynamics computations high fidelity aerodynamics models are too
computation-expensive. However, low fidelity aerodynamics models like
the lifting line theory are not accurate enough or can not provide
a spanwise distribution of the aerodynamic coefficients for complex wing geometries.
This implementation is a medium fidelity implementation of wing aerodynamics
which provides spanwise distribution of the aerodynamic coefficients for
complex wing geometries with moderate accuracy and relatively low
computational cost.
This method is based on [1], [2] and [3].


## Installation

- You need [LADAC](../../README.md)


## Tests

### General

Start a test computation by running `wing_example.m` (located in the [test](test) folder):
  ```
  wing_example
  ```
Two figures should appear: spanwise lift coefficient distribution and geometric visualization of the wing.

### Simulink

Initialize the wing struct, the wing state bus object and the atmosphere bus object (a Simulink file will open and will be run):
  ```
  wing_example_sim_init
  ```
The above test is for a rigid wing with steady aerodynamics. To test a rigid wing with unsteady aerodynamics, run:
  ```
  wing_example_sim_unst_init
  ```

## How to use

### General
- You can define your desired wing:
  - Take a look at `wingCreate`. You will see that you need to specify a parameters file. Therefore you should use the `wing_params_default` as a template.
  - Make a copy of `wing_params_default` and name it `wing_params_mywing`.
  - Adjust the parameters according to the documentation/comments.
  - Now open the script `wing_example.m` located in the [test](test) folder and change the input variables of the function call `wingCreate`. Amend it to the name given to your parameter file.
  - Run `wing_example` again and you will see the geometry of your wing as well as a spanwise lift distribution.
  - For more information, please study the script `wing_example`.

### Simulink

There a four Simulink blocks based on the same core:  
1. The block `wing vlm rigid steady` considers a rigid wing and steady aerodynamics.
2. The block `wing vlm rigid unsteady` considers a rigid wing and unsteady aerodynamics.
3. The block `wing vlm flexible steady` considers a flexible wing and unsteady aerodynamics.
4. The block `wing vlm aeroelastic` considers a flexible wing and unsteady aerodynamics.

The inputs and outputs of these blocks are described below. 

**Inputs/parameters:**

V_ext_local_dt | time-derivative of V_ext_local, in m/s^2
unst_aero_state | unsteady aerodynamics state vectors (8xN_p array), this should be integrated from wing_state.aero.unsteady.x_dt

unst_act2_state | unsteady aerodynamics state vectors of the second actuator (2xN_p array), this should be integrated from wing_state.aero.unsteady.z2_dt
tau_v | dimensionless time of the leading edge vortex of the dynamic stall model (1xN_p array), this should be integrated from wing_state.aero.unsteady.tau_v_dt
Delta_alpha | angle of attack corrections for the VLM to match with the airfoil (1xN_p array), this should be fed back from wing_state.aero.circulation.Delta_alpha with a unit delay to speed up convergence (similar results)
alpha_ind | induced angles of attack (1xN_p array), this should be fed back from wing_state.aero.circulation.alpha_ind with a unit delay to speed up convergence (similar results)

**Outputs:**

The output is a Simulink bus based on the `wing.state` struct.
For the definition of the `wing.state` struct, have a look at `wingCreateState`.
For more detailed information you may have to look inside the code starting with `wingSetState`.
