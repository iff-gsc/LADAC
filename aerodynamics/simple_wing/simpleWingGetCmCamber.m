function [ C_m_camber_np_w ] = simpleWingGetCmCamber( wing, C_L_eta, x_np_wing, alpha_M, beta_M ) %#codegen
% simpleWingGetCmCamber computes the pitching moment coefficient due to
%   camber with respect to the neutral point (np) in the wing (w) frame.
% 
% Inputs:
%   wing            wing struct (see simpleWingLoadParams)
%   C_L_eta         lift coefficient due to flap deflection (1x2 vector)
%   x_wing_b        wing position (wing frame origin) in b frame (scalar),
%                   in m
%   alpha_M         modified angles of attack (1x2 vector), in rad
%   beta_M          modified sideslip angles (1x2 vector), in rad
% 
% Outputs:
%   C_m_camber_np_w pitching moment coefficient due to camber with respect
%                   to the neutral point in wing frame
