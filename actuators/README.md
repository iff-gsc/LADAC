# Actuators

The actuators library is part of LADAC and contains functions and Simulink blocks to compute actuator dynamics.


## Example

Open and run the Simulink file
```
open('actuators_lib_example');
```
Have a look at the scopes.

## How to use

Have a look at the Simulink library `actuators_lib`.
There are a few blocks to model servo dynamics and motor dynamics.
