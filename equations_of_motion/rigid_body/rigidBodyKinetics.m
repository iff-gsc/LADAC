% rigidBodyKinetics computes the time derivative of the velocity and
% angular velocity.
%   The times derivatives are computed depending on the force an moment
%   vector represented in body-fixed frame, mass and inertia matrix of the
%   body, the gravitational acceleration, the DCM from earth frame to
%   body-fixed frame as well as the velocity and the angular velocity.
