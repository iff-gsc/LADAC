# Interfaces to External Programs

The interfaces to external programs library is part of LADAC.
Please refer to the documentation of each [content](#Contents) for more information.

## Contents
- [**ArduPilot custom controller**](ArduPilot_custom_controller)  
This is an interface to an ArduPilot fork, which allows the integration of controllers created in Simulink into ArduPilot.
- [**ArduPilot_SITL**](ArduPilot_SITL)  
This is an interface for physical models created in Simulink to ArduPilot SITL.
- [**FlightGear visualization**](FlightGear_visualization)  
This is a custom interface for physical models created in Simulink to FlightGear for visualization of the aircraft motion.
- [**Qt OpenGL visualization**](Qt_OpenGL_visualization)  
This is a program written in Qt OpenGL for visualization of aircraft motion, being particulary useful for visualizing deformations of flexible aircraft.
- [**TiGL CPACS**](TiGL_CPACS)  
This is an interface to the [Common Parametric Aircraft Configuration Schema (CPACS)](https://cpacs.de/), which allows the import of aircraft parameterized in CPACS to LADAC.
- [**Tornado interface**](tornado_interface)  
The Tornado interface allows easy use of the third-party VLM code Tornado.
